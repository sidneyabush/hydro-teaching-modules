# Stream Hydrology Teaching Module

Interactive Shiny app for exploring stream hydrology metrics and watershed characteristics across North American watersheds. 

## What's in the app

- **Overview tab** — interactive map of all study sites, colored by climate zone, precipitation characterists, RBI, RCS, land use, or LTER network
- **Activity 1: Snow Influence on Flashiness** — explores how snow influences stream flashiness (RBI) and recession behavior (RCS), with scatter plots and side-by-side hydrograph comparisons
- **Activity 2: Stream Salinity** — chloride heatmap across North America, seasonal Cl patterns with optional discharge overlay
- **Activity 3: C-Q Analysis** — concentration-discharge relationships for 10 solutes (Cl, NO3, SO4, Ca, Mg, Na, K, DSi, PO4, DOC). Includes a log-log scatter with trendlines (slope + R²) for up to 3 sites × 2 solutes, and a histogram showing how C-Q slopes are distributed across all sites for a given solute
