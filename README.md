# Stream Hydrology Teaching Module

Interactive Shiny app for exploring stream hydrology metrics and watershed characteristics across North American watersheds.

## What's in the app

- **Overview** — interactive map of all study sites, colored by climate zone, land use, snow metrics, RBI, RCS, or LTER network. Key metric definitions live here.
- **Activity 1: Precipitation Regime Influence on Stream Hydrographs** — explores how snow- or rain-dominated systems impact stream flashiness (RBI) and recession-curve slope (RCS). Click sites on the RCS vs RBI scatter to compare hydrographs.
- **Activity 2: Stream Salinity** — map of Cl concentrations, human-impacted LULC (% Cropland, % Urban), and mean annual precip across North America. Explores Cl trends with seasonal discharge.
- **Activity 3: C-Q Analysis** — concentration-discharge relationships for conservative (Cl) and non-conservative (NO3) tracers. Log-log scatter with trendlines, plus slope distributions across all sites.
