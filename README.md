# Stream Hydrology Teaching Module

Interactive Shiny app for exploring stream hydrology metrics (RBI, recession slope) and their relationship to watershed characteristics across North American LTER and USGS sites. Built for CUAHSI teaching workshops.

## What's in the app

- **Overview tab** — interactive map of all study sites, colored by climate zone, snow fraction, RBI, RCS, land use, or LTER network
- **Activity 1: Snow Influence on Flashiness** — explores how snow influences stream flashiness (RBI) and recession behavior (RCS), with scatter plots and side-by-side hydrograph comparisons
- **Activity 2: Stream Salinity** — chloride heatmap across North America, seasonal Cl patterns with optional discharge overlay
- **Activity 3: C-Q Analysis** — concentration-discharge relationships for 10 solutes (Cl, NO3, SO4, Ca, Mg, Na, K, DSi, PO4, DOC). Includes a log-log scatter with trendlines (slope + R²) for up to 3 sites × 2 solutes, and a histogram showing how C-Q slopes are distributed across all sites for a given solute
