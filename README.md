# Stream Hydrology Teaching Module

Interactive Shiny app for exploring stream hydrology metrics and watershed characteristics across North American watersheds. 

## What's in the app

- **Overview tab** — interactive map of all study sites, colored by climate zone, precipitation characterists, RBI, RCS, land use, or LTER network
- **Activity 1: Precipitation Regime Influence on Stream Hydrographs** — explores how snow- or rain-dominated systems impact stream flashiness (RBI) and recession-curve slope (RCS), behavior. 
- **Activity 2: Stream Salinity** — Displays map of Cl concentrations, human-impacted LULC (% Cropland, % Urban), and mean annual precip across North America. Explores Cl trends with seasonal discharge.
- **Activity 3: C-Q Analysis** — concentration-discharge relationships for conservative (Cl) and non-conservative (NO3) tracers.
